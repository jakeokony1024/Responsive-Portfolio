            <p>Hello my name is Jacob Okony and welcome to my about me page! This page will give an overview of who I
                am, the work I have done as a full stack developer, and what my goals are to provide a clear idea of the
                person I am. I am currently a student of the University of Texas Austin Coding Boot Camp, which is
                devoted to learning how to become a proficient full stack developer, as well as giving me a competitive
                edge in the job market. It has also helped me to transition careers, as I have spent the last fifteen
                years in the food service industry becoming a chef. Although I love food, and love to cook, the job is
                very demanding, and does not allow for much time with family, if at all, and that is a very important
                part of my life.
            </p>
            <p> I have developed many positive qualities in the food industry. These include integrity, attention to
                detail, communication skills, and above all fast and thorough problem-solving skills. I have been a
                manager for eight of the fifteen years in the industry, and am very comfortable being a leader, and
                holding myself and those around me to a standard. I feel these things have been crucial to my success in
                the Coding Boot Camp, and would translate well into the technology industry. </p>
            <p>I have always been fascinated with the tech world, and the internet in general. I remember watching my
                father set up multiple connections to our dial up server so that we could play the same game together on
                two different machines, and at that time realizing that there was great potential with the internet. I
                am excited to dive head first into the technology industry as a full stack developer and am eager to
                provide my work ethic and dedication to the right company! </p>
            <p>On my portfolio page you will find links to some of the web applications I have created, and on every
                page there is a link to my Github account, as well as my LinkedIn account. Feel free to drop me a
                comment on my contact page, and I will respond as soon as I am able!</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting my site!</p>
