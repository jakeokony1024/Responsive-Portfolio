            <p> 
                Full-stack web developer using a management background in the service industry to contribute
                strong problem solving and communication skills to an established development team. Recently
                earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Texas, Austin, with
                skills in MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js as well as responsive web design. 
                Known for attention to detail and being very thorough, using these skills to resolve issues, 
                as well as keeping teams focused and positive throughout a project to overcome obstacles and challenges. 
                I recently used these skills to design an interactive full stack application that connects video gamers 
                together based on similar game interests and playing types. Motivated by a desire to learn as much as 
                possible about the software development field in order to build exciting and new experiences on the web.
